RWD Boilerplate
=========

RWD Boilerplate is built for the purpose of reusing recurring patterns like columns, horizontal aligned elements, images besides text, navigation (both horizontal or vertical) and so on.

## Introduction

RWD Boilerplate does NOT use media queries at all. The responsiveness is achieved by a combination of responsive objects and element queries.
Every single element on a page should be treated independently in my opinion. That can not be achieved with media queries.
Each web application consists of recurring patterns and each pattern can be transformed into an object. That's the main purpose of this framework.

Its purpose is NOT to be an alterative to frameworks like bootstrap or foundation.
